function [WinRej] = dc_continuousArtifactDetect(EEG,varargin)
%Reject commonly recorded artifactual potentials (c.r.a.p.)
% This function has been altered very much by Benedikt Ehinger
% I removed all the filter-features
% I changed the input parser.
%
% There are a number of common artifacts that you will see in nearly every EEG data file. These
% include eyeblinks, slow voltage changes (caused mostly by skin potentials), muscle activity
% (from moving the head or tensing up the muscles in the face or neck), horizontal eye movements,
% and various types of C.R.A.P. (Commonly Recorded Artifactual Potentials).
%
% Although we usually perform artifact rejection on the segmented data, it's a good idea to
% examine the raw unsegmented EEG data first. You can usually identify patterns of artifacts,
% make sure there were no errors in the file, etc., more easily with the raw data [1].
%
% crap.m allows you to automatically identify large peak-to-peak differences or extreme amplitude
% values, within a moving window, across your continuous EEG dataset. After performing crap.m,
% artifactual segments will be rejected and replaced by a 'boundary' event code.
%
%Arguments:
% EEG:         - continuous EEG dataset (EEGLAB's EEG structure)
% 'amplitudeThreshold':     - Thresolds ( values). [-lim +lim] is marked
% 'windowsize':     - moving window width in msec (default 2000 ms)
% 'stepsize':    - moving window step (default 1000 ms)
% 'combineSegements':  - marked segment(s) closer than this value will be joined together.
