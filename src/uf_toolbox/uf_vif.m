function vif = uf_vif(X)
% The VIF is the diagonal of the inverse of the correlation between
% coefficients.
% This Algorithm is taken from Belsley, D. A., E. Kuh, and R. E. Welsch. Regression Diagnostics. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 1980.
%
% Input: A designmatrix X with Columns => Predictors, Rows =>
% Trials/Timepoints. Both Xdc and X can be used.
%
% Output: Variance Inflation Factor. Keep in mind that if you use splines,
% a high VIF is to be expected and usually not a problem (as long as the
% solver converges)
%
% Memory: This function needs 3 x NÂ² bytes Memory. So for a 40.000 predictor
% designmatrix, it takes ~4GB of memory
%
% Example: 
% > vif=uf_vif(EEG.unfold.Xdc)
% > plot(vif,'-o')
