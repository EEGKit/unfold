Toolbox Overview
=================
The unfold toolbox allows to model linear overlaps in between multiple events in EEG data. For example stimulus onsets and keypresses or subsequent fixation onsets in free-viewing.
In addition we allow for non-parametric predictors, thus many (unknown and nonlinear) relations can be modelled in a flexible way.
