Time-Basis functions
===========================================
In the unfold toolbox it is possible to define a time-basisset. This can either be based on splines (temporally defined smooth basis functions) or a fourier set (up to a given frequency).
This greatly reduces the amount of parameter from n-timepoints to a n-splines / (2*n)-frequencies
